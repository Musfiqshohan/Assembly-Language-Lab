we push rbp cz we dont want to use the previous stack. we push the prev rbp. then do our task and then pop
again.

call label similar to jump label  but it can return ip is pushed into stack


L1: push rbp
	push r10
	push r12
	pop rbp
	ret


1. leave ret= we pop every thing before last rbp 
2. we have to return from every possible case
3. [ara+ r11*8] = ara[r11]
4.
