1. handle characters with 1 byte that is al or bl not rax or rbx

2. make upper case: or case insensitive:
	mov dl, 'a'		;if lower case then make it upper
	cmp al, dl
	jge up1
	
	cmp bl,dl
	jge up2
	
	up1:
	sub al,20h
	jmp Compare
	
	
	up2:
	sub bl,20h


3. I can use:
 there's some extra general purpose registers r8 through r15
